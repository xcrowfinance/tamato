# Tariff Management Tool (TAMATO)

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/uktrade/tamato/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/uktrade/tamato)

## Quickstart

### Using Docker

## Environment Variables

Apart from environment variables mentioned in the running locally section, these additional settings are available. 
 
| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- | 
| MINIO_ACCESS_KEY        | Username for local Minio instance (s3 implementation) |
| MINIO_SECRET_KEY        | Password for local Minio instance (s3 implementation  |


## Building

Run the following command to build the docker image:

    docker-compose build


## Running

Run the app:

    docker-compose up
    
On your first run, you will need to run database migrations (in another terminal):

    docker-compose run tamato ./manage.py migrate
    
Create the HMRC bucket:

Browse to Minio http://localhost:9003 and create a local s3 bucket with a name 
matching the HMRC_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME setting in .env

View the app:

Browse to http://localhost:8000/


### Prerequisites

Skip this section if running under docker.

The following dependencies are required to run this app:
 * Python 3.8.x
 * Node 14.16.x
 * Postgres 12.x
 * Redis 5.x

The app requires an s3 bucket on AWS or a compatible implementation, such as Minio


### Running locally

Create a database instance:

    $ sudo su - postgres
    postgres $ createdb tamato

Create a user / role:

    postgres $ psql
    postgres=# CREATE USER <user> SUPERUSER PASSWORD '<password>';

Import from a dump of the database:

    postgres $ psql -d tamato -f /tmp/tamato-db-dump.sql

You can either instruct postgres to trust local connections via settings
in your `pg_hba.conf` file or, preferably, add an entry in your `.env` file in
order to provide the database username and password that you have set (as
above):

    DATABASE_URL=postgres://<user>:<password>@localhost:5432/tamato

Create a Python virtualenv and install the dependencies:

    python -m venv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install -U pip
    pip install wheel
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

Create a `.env` file containing environment variables:

    cp sample.env .env

Fetch and compile GOV.UK Frontend dependency:

    npm install
    npm run build

Collect static assets:

    ./manage.py collectstatic
    
Open another terminal and start Celery beat:

    celery -A common.celery beat --loglevel=info

Open another terminal and start a Celery worker     

    celery -A common.celery worker --loglevel=info     

In the first terminal, run the app:

    ./manage.py runserver

Then you can browse to http://localhost:8000/ to view the app.

In order to login, first create a Django user with superuser access:

    ./manage.py createsuperuser

Set the value of `SSO_ENABLED` environment variable to `false` in your `.env`
and navigate to and sign in via the Django admin login at
http://localhost:8000/admin/.


## Testing

To run tests use the following command:

    ./manage.py test

To run with coverage use the following:

    ./manage.py test -- --cov

When running tests the settings module defaults to settings.test


### Speed up test by without running coverage:

Coverage is enabled when running tests when running with make or pytest:

    make test

    pytest

Running without coverage enabled is significantly faster, use one of the following commands:

    make test-fast

    pytest --no-cov

### Find and debug intermittent test failures:


#### Run tests in a loop

The simplest way to find intermittent test failures is to keep running them in a loop.
It's worth leaving it running for at least a few test runs.

    while pytest -s -v; do :; done

In the example above -s -v is used to output stdout and enable verbose output.
Timing issues more bugs can be surfaced by setting the amount of processes to a number higher than the
amount of CPU threads, e.g. 12 or 16 for an 8 thread CPU:

    while sleep 45 && pytest -s -v -n=12; do :; done

#### Debugging with WebPDB, IPD, PDB++

By default tests run in multiple processes using pytest-xdist - a side effect is that debuggers over stdout
such as pdb, ipdb, pdb++ do not work.

Using webpdb gets round this:  https://pypi.org/project/web-pdb/

When running in a single process (see below) pytest-ipdb or pdb++ can be good choices, in that case use -s
so that pytest doesn't capture stdout:

    pytest -s

#### Run tests in a single process:

Running in a single process can eliminate pytest-xdist as a cause of errors.

    pytest -n0

pytest-random-order randomises the order of test, using it can surface bugs around hidden state, install it:
    
    pip install pytest-random-order

Use random order:

    pytest -n0 --random-order


### Speed up runtimes by using Pyston instead of CPython:

Pyston is a faster python implementation that aims for compatibility with the default CPython implementation.  
Ad-hoc testing on one laptop showed tests completed in 6 minutes in CPython and 4 with Pyston. 

Download and install a release from here: https://github.com/pyston/pyston/releases

 - Create a python environment using venv[1]
-  Install Tamato and it's dependencies to it.
 - Run tests as usual.


[1] The version of virtualenv on Ubuntu 20.04 is old and incompatible, it is advisable to use venv instead here: `$ pyston -mvenv`

## Using the importer

The Tariff Management Tool (TAMATO) needs to import TARIC3 XML data from both the
EU (for historical data) and from HMRC (for VAT measures).

TaMaTo provides an import which parses TARIC3 XML and inserts the data into the
TAMATO database.

Run the script to see the command line arguments:

    ./manage.py import_taric --help

This command is broken into two stages:

1) Chunking the file and loading into the DB. If a file is greater than 50MB it is broken into chunks and those chunks
   saved into the database. This can be run in isolation using the command `./manage.py chunk_taric`.

2) Passing the chunks through the importer system into TrackedModels. This can be run in isolation using the
   command `./manage.py run_import_batch`.

## Using the exporter

The Tariff Management Tool (TAMATO) exports data to HMRC.

During normal operation uploads trigger the upload_transactions task which uploads transactions as XML to the HMRC bucket. 

### Manually trigger the upload to s3

    celery -A common.celery call exporter.tasks.upload_transactions  

The celery job UUID is output and the command quits.  To see output switch to the celery workers console.
A more ergonomic way of launching the celery job is to launch the management command:

    ./manage.py upload_transactions

### Dump transactions

Transactions waiting to be uploaded to the HMRC S3 bucket can be saved to a file or output to stdout
using a management command: 

     ./manage.py dump_transactions [-o filename]
     
Output defaults to stdout if filename is - or is not supplied.


## How to deploy

The app is hosted using GOV.UK PaaS and is deployed with Jenkins.

### Accessing databases in GOV.UK PaaS

To access databases hosted in GOV.UK PaaS directly, you will need a PaaS login and the
[cf CLI tool](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html). There are a couple of useful `Makefile` targets to make creating an SSH
tunnel to the databases easier.

NB this requires [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to be installed too.

```sh
$ make paas-login
> Login to PaaS
API endpoint: api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk

Temporary Authentication Code ( Get one at https://login.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/passcode ): 
```
Open the URL above to login and get a code, then paste it into the terminal. You will then be prompted to select a space:
```sh
Targeted org dit-staging.

Select a space:
1. tariffs-dev
2. tariffs-staging
3. tariffs-training
4. tariffs-uat

Space (enter to skip):
```

Then, start the SSH tunnel
```sh
$ make paas-db-tunnel app=tamato-staging
> Get tamato-staging-db service key...
> SSH Tunnel to tamato-staging-db...
```
At this point, you can connect your local database client to `127.0.0.1:54321`, the credentials are stored in `${app}-db.json` in the current directory - **DO NOT ADD THIS FILE TO THE REPO!**

To close the tunnel, hit Ctrl-c.

For convenience, the following command parses the JSON file and connects using the `psql` client. Run this in another terminal, in the same directory as the JSON file.
```sh
$ make paas-db-tunnel-shell app=tamato-staging
```

Make sure to delete the `${app}-db.json` file after use.

## How to write tests

Tests are written with Pytest

### Formatting.

This project uses the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool to run [black](https://github.com/psf/black) as an autoformatter and [reorder-python-imports](https://github.com/asottile/reorder_python_imports) to format imports.

By pip-installing `requirements-dev.txt` you will have the pre-commit package
installed, so you should now set up your pre-commit hooks:

    $ pre-commit install
